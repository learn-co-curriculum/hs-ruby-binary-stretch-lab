###Getting Down to Business with Binary
<img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/1_to_10.png" width="200px" align="right" hspace="10"> ***This is a group lab, so make sure you are working in a group of 2-4 students***

To start this lab, let's count to ten. Ok, fine, any 3 year old could count to ten. But can you count to ten in binary? How about in hexadecimal? Not so easy...yet!

The number system we use is called the `decimal number system`. We say it is `base 10` because it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. But what happens when we count past 9? We don't have a single symbol for 10, so you have to add 1 in a new column and then start over again at 0 in the ones place.

`0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...now start over by adding a new column (the tens place) worth ten times the first column (the ones place) 10, 11, 12...`

Other systems use different bases. `Binary`, for example, is `base 2`. Because of this, we only have two digits we count with: 0 and 1. Let's see how that works. You count 0, 1, then you have to start over at zero and add a column! The next column is worth twice the value of the first column. Since binary is a base 2 system, each digit represents a power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 2<sup>0</sup> (0), the next representing 2<sup>1</sup> (2), then 2<sup>2</sup> (4), 2<sup>3</sup> (8) and so on.

Decimal | Binary | Explanation
------- | ------ | -----------
0				|	0			 | Start at zero
1				|	1			 | Then 1
2				|	10		 | Start back at zero, add 1 to the left
3				|	11		 | 
4				|	100		 | Start all numbers back at zero again, add one to the left again
5				|	101		 | One in the fours place, one in the ones place
6				|	110		 | One in the fours place, one in the twos place
7				|	111		 | One in the fours place, one in the twos place, one in the ones place
8				|	1000	 | One in the eights place

### Your Challenge
+ Create a method called `decimal_to_binary` that converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent. Your method should take in a decimal as an argument and output it as binary.

+ Create a method called `binary_to_decimal` that converts a binary number to its decimal equivalent. Your program should take in a binary number and output it as a decimal.

Write your code in the `binary.rb` file. Run `learn` to see if your code passes the tests written for it. You should be able to successfully convert the following decimal numbers to binary and binary numbers to decimal:

Decimal | Binary 
------- | ------ 	 
1				|	1			
2				|	10	
13			|	1101		 
34			|	100010	
100			|	1100100
526			|	1000001110	

### Bonus Challenge
Google the `hexadecimal number system`. It works just like binary or decimal, but has a base of 16. Once you've figured out how hexadecimals work, create a program that converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal equivalent, and vice versa (as above). Write your code in the `hexadecimal.rb` file.
